In PixelFinance's Staking Pool, projects can encourage adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to PXF token owners. Users can stake PXF tokens to earn tokens from partner projects.

To learn how to use StakePools to earn tokens from PixelFinance partners, visit the [StakePools](staking-pools/)&#x20;

Users who provide liquidity to DEX can also receive PXF by staking the native LP token PXF-LP to Yield Farms.

See the Yield Farms page for information on how to stake PXF-LP to earn rewards.

If you are interested in creating a staking pool or yield farm for your own crypto project, please visit the [Partnership](../../welcome/contact-us/business-partnerships.md)
