# Yield Farming

PixelSwap provides incentives by providing liquidity for your favorite projects. The more liquidity you provide, the more you earn. It is in our best interest to promote liquidity in PixelSwap's popular trading pairs.

In our Yield Farms, users can stake PXF-LP tokens after providing liquidity and earn higher APY through our platform.

Providing liquidity may expose you to permanent losses and is not risk-free.
