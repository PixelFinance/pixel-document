# Liquidity

## **About PixelSwap Liquidity Pool**

PixelSwap's liquidity pool allows you to provide liquidity by adding your token to the liquidity pool or “LP ”

You can receive PXF-LP tokens by adding them to a liquidity pool (LP)

For example, if you deposit $PXF and $BNB in a liquidity pool, you can receive LP tokens for PXF-BNB.

The number of PXF-LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the PXF-BNB liquidity pool. In addition, by removing liquidity, funds can be redeemed at any time.

## **Impermanent losses**

Providing liquidity may expose you to permanent losses and is not risk-free. [“Simply put, impermanent loss is the difference between holding tokens in an AMM and holding them in your wallet.” - Nate Hindman](https://blog.bancor.network/beginners-guide-to-getting-rekt-by-impermanent-loss-7c9510cb2f22)
