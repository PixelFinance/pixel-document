# Exchange

PixelSwap is a distributed exchange where you can exchange crypto assets, and Exchange is the heart of PixelSwap.

PixelSwap Exchange has several features to support distributed transactions.

### Swap and Trade

PixelSwap's Exchange allows users to execute transactions without going through other exchanges. It also allows users to perform transactions directly through their own wallets, giving them 100% control over the assets they own.

### Liquidity

The reason tokens can be exchanged in PixelSwap is that there is always enough liquidity in the tokens. In the unlikely event that the token you wish to exchange is illiquid, you will not be able to execute the transaction.

So PixelSwap provides liquidity so that you can get LP tokens and then use those LP tokens for various rewards.
