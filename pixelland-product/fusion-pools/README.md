# Fusion Pools

![](../../.gitbook/assets/pixel\_docs031.png)

Fusion Pool allows users to earn real-time payouts by betting on a combination of NFTs in PixelLand.

A portion of the blind box amount purchased by the user goes into the Fusion Pool. The higher the points, the higher the percentage of the payout you get.

Unlike the Staking Pool, you do not need to burn NFTs to win BNBs.
