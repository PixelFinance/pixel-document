# Single Pools

PixelLand's Staking Pool can earn PixelFinanceTokens by taking a portion of the amount of blind boxes purchased by the user and betting the NFT received. It's very simple.

In order to get PixelFinanceTokens, you need to burn NFTs, which will be paid out in real time.

If you want to cancel the staked NFTs, the reward will be lost, but you will get your NFTs back.
