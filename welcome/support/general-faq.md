## **What is the difference between staking and farming?**

Staking: In order to earn PXF or other tokens, you need to stake PXF. For more information on staking, please [click here](../../pixelswap-product/stake/staking-pools/)

Farming:To farm, you need to provide liquidity to one of the liquidity pools on the farm page and wager LP tokens to earn rewards. For more information on farming, please [click here](../../pixelswap-product/stake/yield-farming/)

Both have advantages and disadvantages. Which you choose depends on your strategy.

## Why is my transaction failing?

1. Make sure you have paid enough for the gas.

4. If the problem still persists, please contact someone in the community group.
