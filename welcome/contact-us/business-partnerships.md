## Provide your token to Pools or Farms

If you provide your tokens to the Staking Pool, you can distribute them to the users who will stake the PXF.

Yield Farm can incentivize users to provide liquidity by distributing PXF to LP token holders.

On PixelFinance, the two products work together. If a project provides tokens to a staking pool, we will also consider creating a Yield Farm. If you are interested in distributing tokens to increase liquidity, please contact us.

## **PixelStarter (token sale)**

PixelStarter is the token sale model used by PixelFinance. PixelStarter works as follows.

* Users will use BUSD to purchase the newly issued token.
* After the sale, we will distribute the procured BUSD to the customer, and exchange some of the procured BUSD for PXF and burn it.

## **Listing on exchanges**

### **How do I list a token on an exchange?**

Any token from the BEP-20 network can be listed on PixelSwap. You do not need to contact us or get our permission. All you need to do is add liquidity to our liquidity pool. Traders can trade your token by entering the contract address of your token.

### **Can I block someone if they make a fake token of mine?**

As PixelSwap is an AMM-based DEX, we cannot prevent the buying and selling of BEP-20 tokens. We recommend that you clearly display the token agreement on your site for all to see, and educate your users on how to trade tokens safely.
